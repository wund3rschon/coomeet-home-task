# Coomeet Home Task

The goal is to build a simple app showing current weather based on user's location

## Task requirements

- Vue + TypeScript + Less/SCSS
- any free weather forecasting API (e.g. https://openweathermap.org/api)
- error processing (API errors, no access to Geolocation API, etc.)
- HTML layouts should not use frameworks
- no external libraries except for basic vue-cli setup

## Project setup

To start a development server, open the terminal and run
```
npm ci && npm run serve
```

The server should be available at http://localhost:8080
